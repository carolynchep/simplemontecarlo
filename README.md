This simple Monte Carlo simulation aims to estimate the probability of obtaining a sum of 10 when rolling three fair dice, returning the probability estimate. 

In this analysis, we explore the influence of two factors: the number of rolls and the number of estimates per simulation on the resulting probabilities.

From the histograms, it becomes evident that the number of rolls has a significant impact on the overall standard deviation of the probability. The fewer the number of rolls, the higher the variance in probability, showing that a higher number of rolls leads to higher accuracy in the data.

On the second row of the histograms, we observe that the number estimates per simulation has a relatively minor impact on the accuracy of the probabilities since the standard deviations do not greatly differ. Nevertheless, increasing the number of estimates tends to reduce the standard deviation in probability values, indicating a trend toward improved precision with a larger number of estimates.
